The FHFA began setting caps on Fannie and Freddie's multifamily businesses in 2014 in an effort to support liquidity in the multifamily market while also working to prevent private capital from being crowded out. Beyond expanding the size of the caps, the FHFA also made other revisions to how Fannie and Freddie can conduct their multifamily businesses.
